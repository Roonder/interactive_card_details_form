## My process

This was a really difficult project for me. I've never done a credit card form using, and also using JavaScript Vanilla.
Stills being a really breakable and improvable app but I'm looking for advices and possible comments to implement better
practices on the build up of this project. But, it was really fun to think from scratch trying to not use any kind of help
from the Frontend Mentor forums.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- SASS (https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS Pre-processor
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript ES6
- Gulp (https://gulpjs.com/) - Node.js Toolkit
- Node.js (https://nodejs.org/es/) - JavaScript Enviroment

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

During the build of this project I learned how to implement some good practices about validating the forms and how to implement
this functionalities to the app. Although, I have a really long way to go to improve this project and make myself comfortable doing
this kind of apps.

### Continued development

I want to use the things that I learned right here to improve my validating skills and my DOM Manipulation using JavaScript
without stopping too much on researching the right way of traversing the DOM, or calling some functions. Actually would be really good to know:

- How can I improve my Input Error Messages, on functionality and styles
